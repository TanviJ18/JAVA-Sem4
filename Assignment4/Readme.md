In this Java programme, a deck of cards is represented as an array of objects. These characteristics apply to the Card class:

The rank and suit of each card are denoted by integers ranging from 0 to 12 and 0 to 3, respectively. To generate cards with appropriate ranks and suits, the Card class offers constructors with default and parameterized options. The rank and suit of each card are stored in the private data members of the Card class. A deck of cards can be made, printed, compared, sorted, and an unique card can be located inside the deck using the Card class' methods. A menu-driven interface for interacting with a deck of cards is provided by the DeckOfCards class.
The program allows you to:

Print the whole deck of cards. Create a unique card for each level and suit. Sort the cards in the deck. By rank and suit, locate a certain card in the deck. Five cards are dealt at random from the deck. Shut down the programme. A deck of cards is created and managed by the DeckOfCards class using the Card class. The user is prompted to choose one of the aforementioned alternatives, and then the application executes the associated action.

Run the DeckOfCards class after compiling both the Card and DeckOfCards classes to execute the application. To interact with the deck of cards, follow the steps.

Thank You.
